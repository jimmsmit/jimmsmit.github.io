📢 New Publication! 📢\
 <br/>
Our data-driven analysis of randomised trials to predict benefit from corticosteroids in hopitalised Community-Acquired-Pneumonia (CAP) is now available in the latest issue of Lancet Respiratory Medicine\
 <br/>
Here are the key take-aways:\
 <br/>
💡 The Controversy:
<ul>
    <li>Routine corticosteroid use for CAP is debated, with conflicting recommendations in recent SCCM and ERS / ESICM ESCMID / ALAT guidelines.</li>
    <li>While some guidelines suggest corticosteroids for severe CAP, evidence remains insufficient and the definition of “severe” inconsistent</li>
</ul>
 

🔍 What We Did:
<ul>
    <li>Conducted an individual patient data meta-analysis, covering 8 RCTs and 3,248 patients hospitalised with CAP.</li>
    <li>Focused on analysing heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) using data-driven approaches</li>
    <li>We developed and externally validated a novel corticosteroid-effect model, pinpointing baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) as a critical predictor for benefit</li>
</ul>

📊 Key Findings:
<ul>
    <li>We found significant overall mortality reduction from corticosteroids in hospitalized CAP, but ...</li>
    <li>Survival benefits were tied to high baseline CRP concentrations (>204 mg/L), while patients with lower CRP concentrations showed no mortality benefit.</li>
    <li>Contrary to earlier assumptions, we found no significant HTE between less severe vs severe CAP (PSI class I–III vs IV–V).</li>
    <li>Trade-offs: Overall increased hospital re-admissions and hyperglycaemia incidence due to corticosteroid use.</li>
</ul>


🧠 Implications for Practice:
<ul>
    <li>Current guidelines overlook CRP levels in corticosteroid treatment decisions.h</li>
    <li>Our study paves the way for more targeted corticosteroid therapy in CAP, through threshold-based CRP guidance</li>
    
</ul>
